| **Incident Analysis & Resolution** | When I shifted to a new room, no bulbs were burning in that room. Then I checked by putting two to three different bulbs in the bulb holder. Still the bulb was not burning. Then I called the electrician and when theelectrician checked the holder, he said that your holder is bad. Then I brought a new holder. Then I checked the bulb,my problem was solved.|
